I would like to summarize, in this post, two very useful and easy ways to have a blog. On the one hand, Postach.io and Evernote; and on the other hand, GitHub.

Postach.io and Evernote are useful tools for bloggers that make it easy to create and publish content. GitHub can also be used to create a blog. Forking Barry Clark's jekyll-now template on GitHub allows you to use the code and configuration from the original repository as the basis for your own blog project.
 
## Postach.io and Evernote

If you are someone who regularly writes on your blog, or you just like to keep everything in order, then these two services will surely interest you.
[Postach.io](https://postach.io/) is a platform that allows you to post your Evernote directly to your blog. [Evernote](https://evernote.com/intl/es), for its part, is an application that helps you save and organize all your important information, from notes to files and photos. Together, these two services allow you to create and publish a blog, with content, quickly and easily.
 
### Overview of how to create a blog with Postach.io and Evernote

To post an Evernote note on Postach.io, you first need to have an account on both platforms. Once you're signed in to Evernote, you can create a note like you normally would. Then, when you're ready to publish, simply give the note the "published" tag. Next, you will have to select a folder to host the note and that will be the one that Postach.io sees.

If you haven't linked your Evernote account with Postach.io yet, you'll need to do so first. To do this, go to the Postach.io settings page and select the Evernote folder where the notes that serve as blog posts are located. Then link your accounts. Once you've done this, you'll be able to post Evernote notes to Postach.io without any issues.

## GitHub

As I mentioned earlier, Postach.io is a platform that allows you to post your Evernote notes directly to your blog. However, if you are a GitHub, you can also use this service to create and publish a blog.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a very popular platform among software developers as it allows them to efficiently collaborate on projects. However, it can also be used as a blogging platform, allowing you to easily post your thoughts and reflections.
 
### Overview of creating a blog on GitHub

To create a blog on GitHub, you first need to have an account on the platform. Once you're logged in, you can create a new repository for your blog. A repository is like a directory where you can store your files and code.

To create a repository, go to the main GitHub page and select the "New" option. Next, choose a name for your repository and select the “Create repository” option. You will then be prompted to select a template for your blog. You can choose from several predefined options, or you can create a custom template if you wish.

Once you've created your repository, you can start publishing your blog posts. To do so, you simply need to create a file in the repository using the [Markdown](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). You can then publish your blog posts using the GitHub interface, or you can use a desktop app like [Prose.io](https://prose.io/).

An easy way to use GitHub to create a blog is to fork Barry Clark's jekyll-now template. Forking means copying an existing repository to your own GitHub account, allowing you to use the original repository's code and configuration as the basis for your own project.

To fork jekyll-now, you first need to have a GitHub account. Once you're logged in, go to the jekyll-now template page at [https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and select the "Fork" option in the top right corner of the screen. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

You can then use the repository copy you just made to create your own blog. To do so, you simply need to change some basic details like the title and description of your blog in the _config.yml file. Once you've done this, you can start publishing blog posts using the Markdown format.
